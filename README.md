## üåü Overview

This repository serves as a portfolio of my journey in learning Java through Object-Oriented Programming. Each program demonstrates a different aspect of OOP, such as:

- **Classes & Objects**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Abstraction & Interfaces**
- **Exception Handling**

Feel free to browse through the code and see how these concepts are implemented.

## üöÄ Programs

Here‚Äôs a quick look at some of the key programs in this repository:

- **[Program 1: Class and Object Basics](link_to_program_1)**  
  *A simple program demonstrating the creation of classes and objects.*
  
- **[Program 2: Inheritance](link_to_program_2)**  
  *A program illustrating how inheritance works in Java.*

- **[Program 3: Polymorphism](link_to_program_3)**  
  *An example of polymorphism using method overriding.*

- **[Program 4: Encapsulation](link_to_program_4)**  
  *A program showcasing the importance of encapsulation in Java.*

- **[Program 5: Abstract Classes and Interfaces](link_to_program_5)**  
  *Exploring abstract classes and interfaces.*

- **[Program 6: Exception Handling](link_to_program_6)**  
  *Handling exceptions in Java.*
